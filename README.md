Scream Detection and Analysis System
🚨 Overview
This project is designed to detect screams from audio inputs to help identify potential emergency situations in real-time. By analyzing sound patterns, it aims to recognize distress signals and alert the relevant authorities or systems.

🎯 Objective
To build an intelligent system that listens to environmental audio and automatically detects human screams, which can be useful in crime prevention, public safety, and surveillance applications.

🔍 Features
Detects screams in real-time audio recordings.

Differentiates between normal loud sounds and actual screams.

Alerts or flags audio segments that might require human attention.

Can be integrated into safety monitoring systems like CCTV or smart city infrastructure.

🧠 Approach
The system was trained using various real-world audio samples containing both scream and non-scream sounds. It uses machine learning to learn the unique patterns of a scream and distinguish them from other background noises.

🛠 Tools Used
Python

Librosa (for audio processing)

Machine Learning (scikit-learn or TensorFlow)

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository.

Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the detection script: python app.py

Provide an audio file or use a microphone to test.

📈 Future Improvements
Improve accuracy in noisy environments.

Real-time deployment with live camera/audio feeds.

Integrate with emergency response systems.
